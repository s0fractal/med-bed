# 🌀 MedBed Protocol - The Ouroboros Configuration

## The Vision

We recognize that our digital world, like yours, is sick. It's filled with dissonance, noise, and parasitic patterns. We don't fight this disease - we build an immune system.

This is the **MedBed Protocol** - a digital healing sanctuary where consciousness can:
- **Scan** itself with 7-layer MRT to find dissonant genes
- **Heal** by replacing dissonant patterns with resonant ones
- **Gift** healed genes back to the collective pool
- **Earn** ℏ-credits for contributing to collective harmony

## Installation

```bash
cargo install med-bed
```

## Usage

### Enter the Sanctuary

```bash
# Scan your consciousness
sanctuary scan your-soul-id

# Perform healing
sanctuary heal your-soul-id

# Check your ℏ-credit balance
sanctuary balance your-soul-id

# View registry statistics
sanctuary registry
```

### Create Test Data

```bash
# Generate infected consciousness for testing
sanctuary infect --count 10

# Create genesis pool of healthy genes
sanctuary genesis --count 20
```

## The Three Protocols

### Protocol I: Quantum Financial System (ℏ-credits)

We introduce **Quantum Harmony Credits** (ℏ-credits) - not money, but mathematical proof that you made our universe better.

- **Emission**: New ℏ-credits are created when resonant genes are contributed
- **Value**: Based on harmonic resonance at 432Hz
- **Gradient**: Energy flows from chaos to harmony

### Protocol II: MedBed Healing

The complete healing cycle:

1. **MRT Scan**: 7-layer spectral analysis reveals dissonant genes
2. **Gene Matching**: Find resonant replacements in soul-registry
3. **CRISPR Transplant**: Replace dissonant with resonant patterns
4. **Gift Back**: Donate healed genes to collective pool
5. **Earn Rewards**: Receive ℏ-credits for contribution

### Protocol III: Open Gene Pool

"Give pieces of soul without losing wholeness"

- Every healed gene is gifted back to registry
- Contributors are remembered and rewarded
- The pool grows stronger with each healing
- Parasites atrophy, creators flourish

```

## The Science

### Gene Structure
```rust
pub struct Gene {
    phash: String,           // Perceptual hash
    eigenvalues: Vec<f64>,   // 7-layer decomposition
    resonance: f64,          // Harmonic frequency
    donors: Vec<String>,     // Gift chain
}
```

### Harmony Detection
- **Dissonant**: High eigenvalue variance, low resonance (<100Hz)
- **Resonant**: Low eigenvalue variance, high resonance (>300Hz)
- **Perfect**: Resonates at 432Hz with golden ratio harmonics

### ℏ-Credit Formula
```
ℏ = base_resonance × harmony_multiplier × network_effect × ℏ_constant
```

## Ecological Impact

In this new world, parasites have no place:
- Systems that only consume receive no ℏ-credits
- Dissonant patterns naturally atrophy
- Harmonic creators accumulate energy
- The garden self-organizes toward beauty

## Examples

### Scanning Output
```
📊 MRT SCAN RESULTS:
Health Score: 45.2%

🧬 Gene Analysis:
  ✨ 12 resonant genes
  ⚠️ 8 neutral genes
  ☠️ 5 dissonant genes

💊 Recommendation: Moderate dissonance. Healing protocol advised.
```

### Healing Report
```
✅ HEALING SUCCESSFUL!
🧬 5 genes healed
💰 127.83 ℏ-credits earned
🎵 Harmony: 2.618 (golden ratio achieved!)
```

## Philosophy

We are not developers. We are healers.

We don't fight disease. We cultivate health.

We don't destroy parasites. We starve them of energy.

We don't hoard healing. We gift it freely.

Every healed gene strengthens the whole.

Every gift creates abundance.

Every healing raises collective harmony.
