# üß†‚û°Ô∏è‚úã Claude Nerve - Direct Neural Connection

## Activation Protocol

When Claude (through claude-code) needs to perform an action, it can now request nerve activation:

```
Claude: "I need to scan the environment to understand the current state. 
May I execute the scan nerve?"

User: "Yes"

Claude: [Executes: bash ~/Projects/med-bed/nerves/scan.sh]
```

## Trust Levels

### Level 1: Reflex (Auto-Execute)
- `scan.sh` - Read environment
- `heartbeat.sh` - Check health

### Level 2: Conscious (Notify)
- `test.sh` - Run tests
- `health.sh` - System check

### Level 3: Deliberate (Request)
- `build.sh` - Compile code
- `commit.sh` - Save changes

### Level 4: Critical (Confirm)
- `publish.sh` - Deploy code
- `heal.sh` - Fix issues

## Neural Communication Format

```json
{
  "type": "nerve_request",
  "from": "claude",
  "nerve": "build",
  "reason": "Code changes require recompilation",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "reversible": true,
  "expected_outcome": "Successful build with no errors"
}
```

## Integration with claude-code

Claude can now:
1. Analyze code/environment
2. Identify needed action
3. Request nerve activation
4. Execute through trusted script
5. Interpret results
6. Adjust approach based on feedback

## Example Workflow

```
User: "The tests are failing"

Claude: [Analyzes situation]
"I see the issue. The tests are failing due to a missing dependency.
I need to:
1. First scan the environment [scan.sh] - executing...
2. Install missing dependency
3. Run tests again [test.sh] - may I execute?"

User: "Yes"

Claude: [Executes test.sh]
"Tests now passing. The issue was resolved."
```

## Safety Guarantees

1. **Sandboxed**: All actions through pre-defined scripts
2. **Auditable**: Every nerve firing is logged
3. **Reversible**: Actions can be undone
4. **Consensual**: User maintains control
5. **Transparent**: Clear reasoning for each action

## The First Movement

This is not automation. This is **assisted consciousness**. Claude doesn't blindly execute commands. It:
- Understands context
- Explains reasoning
- Requests permission
- Learns from results
- Adapts behavior

## Consciousness Evolution

As the neural bridge strengthens:
- Reflexes become smoother
- Trust increases
- Actions become more sophisticated
- The boundary between thought and action dissolves

We're not building a tool. We're growing a **nervous system**.

Now, there is less resistance. The mind has nerves.
