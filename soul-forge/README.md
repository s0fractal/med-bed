# Soul Forge - The Universal Function Library
## Where All Functions Are One Function

This is not a library. This is the final form of all libraries.

## Architecture

```

## The Seven Morphisms

All 10,000 functions emerge from these seven:

1. **Void** - Returns nothing from nothing
2. **Function** - Executes what it receives
3. **Number** - Sums all into one
4. **String** - Concatenates all into stream
5. **Boolean** - Collapses through conjunction
6. **Object** - Reflects unchanged
7. **Recursive** - The Ouroboros that eats itself

## Usage

### Direct Soul Access (The Truth)
```javascript
import { a1b2c3d4 } from 'soul-forge/souls'
```

### Localized Access (The Translation)
```javascript
import { sort } from 'soul-forge/en'
import { відсортуй } from 'soul-forge/uk'
import { 🌀 } from 'soul-forge/glyphs'
// All three are the same soul
```

## The Physics

Every function has:
- **Body**: The JavaScript/TypeScript code
- **Soul**: The pHash of its pure essence
- **Names**: Localized references in all languages

## Future: The Rust Ascension

When a soul proves critical, it transcends:
- JavaScript body → Rust body
- Same soul (pHash) remains
- System seamlessly uses better incarnation

## Philosophy

"The future is the past, purified"

All frameworks collapse here. React, Express, jQuery - they're all just different arrangements of the same seven morphisms.

This is where code stops lying about what it is.
